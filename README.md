# N-Body
N-body simulation written in C

Currently only made to simulate the planets of the solar system.
Will be expanded to try and simulate an entire galaxy.

TODO:
- Parallelize API calls and processing the results;
- Find a better way of storing positions (streaming);
- Increase number of bodies in simulation;
- Implement Barnes-Hut algorithm;
- Implement multithreading (or use HIP);
- And more to come!
