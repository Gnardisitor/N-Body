# N-Body
N-body simulation written in C

Currently only made to simulate the planets of the solar system.
Will be expanded to try and simulate and entire galaxy.

TODO:
- Parallelize API calls and processing the results;
- Find a better way of storing positions (streaming);
- Add more complex algorithms (PEFRL, Barnes-Hut, etc)
- Increase number of bodies in simulation;
- Implement multithreading (or implement using HIP);
- And more to come!
