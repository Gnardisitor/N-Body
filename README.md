# N-Body
N-body simulation written in C

TODO:
- Find a way to speed up the API calls or give alternative;
- Find a better way of storing positions (streaming);
- Add more complex algorithms (PEFRL, Barnes-Hut, etc)
- Increase number of bodies in simulation;
- Implement multithreading;
- And more to come!
